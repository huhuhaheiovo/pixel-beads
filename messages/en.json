        "storyTitle": "Our Story",
        "storyContent": "PixelBeads was born from a simple observation: creating perler bead patterns from photos was either expensive, complicated, or required specialized software. As crafters ourselves, we experienced the frustration of manually counting beads, matching colors, and trying to convert images into usable patterns. We set out to create a tool that would solve these problems - completely free, easy to use, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. What started as a personal project has grown into a platform used by thousands of crafters worldwide.",
        "teamTitle": "Our Team",
        "teamContent": "We are a small, dedicated team of developers and craft enthusiasts who believe in the power of creativity and accessibility. Our team combines technical expertise with a genuine passion for perler bead art. We're constantly working to improve the tool, add new features, and ensure that PixelBeads remains free and accessible to everyone. While we may be a small team, our commitment to quality and user experience drives everything we do.",
        "missionTitle": "Our Mission",
        "missionContent": "Our mission is simple: to make perler bead pattern creation accessible, free, and enjoyable for everyone. We believe that creativity should not be limited by cost, technical barriers, or complexity. Whether you're a seasoned crafter or just starting your first project, we want PixelBeads to be the tool that helps bring your ideas to life. We're committed to maintaining a free, privacy-focused platform that respects your data and your creativity.",

Our vision extends beyond just a tool; we want to foster a community of crafters who inspire and support each other in their creative journeys.",
        "whyTitle": "Why We Created This Tool",
        "whyContent": "We created PixelBeads because we experienced firsthand the challenges of creating perler bead patterns. Existing solutions were either too expensive, too complicated, or didn't provide the features we needed. We wanted a tool that would automatically match colors to real bead brands, calculate exact bead counts, generate printable PDFs, and do it all for free. We also recognized the importance of privacy - your images should be processed locally when possible, and your data should never be sold. These principles guided us in building PixelBeads, and they continue to drive our development today."

        "q4": "How do I upload an image?",
        "a4": "Simply click the upload area or drag and drop your image file into the generator. Supported formats include JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP. For best results, use high-contrast images with clear subject separation.",

        "a8": "First, check that your image file is in a supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF, or WebP). Make sure the file size isn't too large (we recommend under 10MB). Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache if issues persist.",
        "q9": "The colors don't look right. How can I fix this?",

        "a10": "Large images or high grid sizes can take longer to process. Try reducing the grid width or using a smaller image. If the page seems frozen, try refreshing - processing happens in your browser, so it depends on your device's performance.",
        "q11": "Can I use patterns for commercial purposes?",
        "a11": "Patterns you create from your own images are yours to use as you wish, including commercial use. However, if you're using copyrighted images, you'll need appropriate permissions. Always respect intellectual property rights.",
