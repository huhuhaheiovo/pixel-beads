# SEO Optimization & Feature Updates

We're excited to announce that PixelBeads has completed a major SEO optimization and feature update. This update focuses on improving search engine visibility and user experience, while providing the creator community with more ways to show support.

## Pattern Detail Page SEO Optimization

We've added comprehensive SEO metadata to each pattern detail page, including:

### Dynamic Meta Tags

- **Title Optimization**: Each pattern page now has a unique title in the format "Pattern Name Perler Bead Pattern", ensuring titles are both keyword-rich and naturally readable
- **Description Optimization**: Automatically generated descriptions include pattern dimensions, author, brand, and other details to help users quickly understand the pattern
- **Open Graph Tags**: Optimized for social media sharing, making shared links more attractive
- **Multilingual Support**: Proper Canonical URLs and language switching links for both English and Chinese versions

### Structured Data (Schema Markup)

Added JSON-LD structured data using the `CreativeWork` type, including:
- Pattern name and description
- Creation date and author information
- Pattern dimensions (width and height)
- Material brand information

This structured data helps search engines better understand page content and improves display in search results.

### Enhanced Page Content

Pattern detail pages now display richer information:

- **Creation Date**: Shows when the pattern was created, with support for both English and Chinese date formats
- **Pattern Description**: If a pattern includes a description, it's clearly displayed on the page
- **Pattern Dimensions**: Displayed in the format "width × height beads"
- **Author Information**: Improved display of author information

## Pattern Library Page SEO Optimization

The pattern library page has also undergone comprehensive SEO optimization:

### Page Structure Optimization

- **H1 Title**: Updated to "Perler Bead Patterns Gallery"
- **H2 Headings**: Added structured headings like "Popular Pixel Art & Fuse Bead Designs" and "Turn Patterns into Custom Pixel Art"
- **Natural Keyword Integration**: Naturally integrated keywords like "Pixel Art Perler Beads", "Fuse Bead Patterns", and "Perler Bead Ideas" throughout the page content

### Image SEO Optimization

Added complete SEO attributes to each pattern preview:

- **Alt Text**: Format "perler bead pattern pixel art pattern name"
- **Title Attribute**: Format "Perler Bead Pixel Art – Pattern Name"
- Improved image discoverability in search engines

### Internal Linking Optimization

Added a CTA section at the bottom of the pattern library page linking to the generator, creating an internal linking loop to help users discover more features.

## New Sponsorship Features

To support the continued operation and development of the site, we've added two sponsorship options:

### Buy Me a Coffee

Added a Buy Me a Coffee sponsorship badge in the site footer. Users can click the badge to directly jump to the sponsorship page and support the site's development.

### WeChat Appreciation QR Code

Added WeChat appreciation QR code functionality:

- **Click to Enlarge**: Clicking the WeChat icon opens a dialog displaying a large QR code (300x300px) for easy scanning
- **Responsive Design**: QR code displays clearly on different devices
- **UX Optimization**: Uses a modal dialog to avoid layout issues from previous hover display

## Technical Improvements

### Component Optimization

- Created an independent WeChatQRCode client component using Dialog component for click-to-enlarge functionality
- Optimized SEO attributes for images in the PatternGrid component
- Improved semantic HTML usage in page structure

### Internationalization Support

All new features fully support both English and Chinese, including:

- Multilingual versions of SEO metadata
- Translated page content
- Localized user interface

## Next Steps

We plan to continue optimizing:

- Add more pattern categories and filtering features
- Optimize image loading performance
- Add user favorites and sharing features
- Continuously improve SEO strategy
