# Pattern Generator UI Optimization Update

We are excited to announce that the Perler Bead Pattern Generator has completed a major feature update and UI optimization! This update focuses on improving the creative experience and visual effects, allowing you to preview and export patterns more flexibly.

## New Bead Style Selection Feature

### Three Styles Available

You can now freely choose from three different bead styles in the generator:

#### 1. Square Beads

The classic square bead style, the most traditional perler bead appearance. Perfect for:
- Traditional perler bead projects
- Designs requiring clear grid lines
- Classic pixel art style

#### 2. Round Beads

Round bead style with a softer visual effect. Perfect for:
- Modern-style perler bead projects
- Designs requiring a more natural appearance
- Projects pursuing soft visual effects

#### 3. Hollow Beads

Hollow bead style with unique visual effects. Perfect for:
- Creative perler bead projects
- Designs requiring special visual effects
- Projects pursuing unique styles

### Real-Time Preview

After selecting different bead styles, you can see the effect in real-time on the canvas without waiting for export. This allows you to:

- **Quick Comparison**: Easily switch between different styles to find the most suitable visual effect
- **Instant Adjustment**: Adjust designs based on preview effects, improving creative efficiency
- **Accurate Preview**: What you see is what you get, ensuring the final effect meets expectations

## UI Style Optimization

## Technical Highlights
